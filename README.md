# Aviation Data Regression Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused **on regression analysis of aviation and passenger data**. The goal is to explore, preprocess, and model datasets derived from flight logs and passenger records, enabling valuable insights and predictions.

## 📖 Project Overview

The project includes the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering datasets related to flight logs and passenger records.
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, transforming, and organizing data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training regression models to analyze relationships within the data.
4. **Result Interpretation**: Visualizing and interpreting model outputs to extract meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Features

- End-to-end data analysis pipeline.
- Implementation of **regression models** tailored for aviation data.
- Comprehensive visualizations for interpreting results.

## 📋 Requirements

To run the project, you need the following:

- Python 3.11 or later

## 🔧 Installation

Requirements are installed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perquis/aviation.git
   cd aviation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## 🔥 How to run?

To run this project and analyze aviation data, follow these steps:

1. Run this command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   juptyer notebook
   ```
2. Open [demo](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/main.ipynb) in your browser to see machine learning and solutions.

## 📚 Dataset

The project uses aviation and passenger data from publicly available sources. Ensure you comply with the data source terms of use. If you want to see this data, you can find it in the `data` directory. We have prepared a sample dataset for demonstration purposes but if you want to see the full dataset, please contact us.

## 🚀 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to data providers and **contributors (students from Lazarski University)** for making this project possible!
